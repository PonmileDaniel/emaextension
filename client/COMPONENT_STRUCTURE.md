# EMA Extension - Component Structure

This project has been refactored from a single large component into a modular structure with separated components and CSS files.

## CSS Conversion

All Tailwind CSS classes have been converted to regular CSS:
- Each component has its own CSS file
- Colors, spacing, and layouts maintained
- Responsive and modern styling
- Hover states and transitions preserved

## Removed Files

- `options.jsx` - Not needed for this popup-focused extension
- `options.html` - Removed corresponding HTML file
- Updated `manifest.json` to remove options page reference
- Updated `vite.config.js` to remove options build target

## Key Features Maintained

- Three-state workflow: initial → loading → results
- Collapsible audit sections
- Professional UI with consistent branding
- Social sharing functionality
- Responsive design within popup constraints
- Icon integration with Lucide React

## Dependencies

- React 19.1.1
- React DOM 19.1.1
- Lucide React (for icons)
- Vite (for building)

The extension is now modular, maintainable, and follows React best practices with separated concerns.
